Title : Classification Analysis of PPKM Implementation in Jakarta
- Make a background story about the problem you want to bring (such as a warning from WHO on mobility during a pandemic)
- Determine project goals
- Analyzing the link between mobility and Covid-19 cases and the implementation of PPKM in Jakarta
- Analyzing the link between vaccination and Covid-19 cases
- Analyzing the success of PPKM on Covid-19 cases in Jakarta
- Creating a classification model as a recommendation for implementing PPKM in Jakarta
- Then do Exploratory Data Analysis with the variable:
daily mobility jakarta
daily positive case jakarta
correlation between daily mobility and daily positive
vaccination against daily positive
- Doing modeling
- Final Conclusion
1. Not all daily COVID data affect the determination of the PPKM policy every week.
2. The use of classification models can be used to assist considerations in determining the status of PPKM based on data from the previous week.
